# Hello world!

This is a snappy demo package that shows how to build and package a minimalistic webserver
in golang for snappy.

Just follow these steps and you are all set to start innovating in the snappy world:

    go build .
    mkdir magic-bin/x86_64-linux-gnu
    mv go-example-webserver magic-bin/x86_64-linux-gnu/

 And similarly for armhf:

    GOARCH=arm go build .
    mkdir magic-bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf
    mv go-example-webserver magic-bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf/

And finally build the snap

    snappy build .


This produces a snappy package for you that you can try on your snappy system.

Have fun!
